# Merge Conflicts

## How they happen
Most of the time they happen when 2 folks are working on the same branch but someone didn't pull down the new changes before  making their changes thus creating confusion in the system

## How to fix them
There are 2 ways to fix them.

1. On github directly
2. Through VS code

It all depends on the developer as to how they chose to do it.
